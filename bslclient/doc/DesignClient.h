\section introduction Introduction
\n
\subsection purpose Purpose
BOINC Sentinels is meant to be an incubation project to explore different user
interfaces and data models for displaying data about a BOINC client.
BOINC (http://boinc.berkeley.edu) is an open source project for volunteer
computing/distributed computing (http://www.distributedcomputing.info/).\n

\subsection scope Scope
This software design document describes the architecture and system design of the
BOINC Sentinels User Interface Libraries.\n
\n
Specifically:
\li libbslclient

\subsection intendedaudience Intended Audience
The intended audience for this document are engineers or researchers, who want
to modify and/or extend the existing reference implementation. As described software
is implemented using wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org/), the reader should have some
knowledge of the C/C++ programming language as well user interface event driven
methodologies.
